                    "Fueled by advances in statistics and computer science, as well as better datasets and the growth of neural networks, machine learning has truly taken off in recent years."
                    "Today, whether you realize it or not, machine learning is everywhere â€’ automated translation, image recognition, voice search technology, self-driving cars, and beyond.")
        st.markdown("Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of statistical techniques and data to train algorithms, allowing them to improve their performance over time through experience."
                    "In traditional programming, humans write explicit instructions that tell computers how to perform specific tasks. However, in machine learning, computers learn from patterns and examples found in data, and then use this learned knowledge to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.")

The model is tested on the preprocessed testing data to evaluate its effectiveness.")
