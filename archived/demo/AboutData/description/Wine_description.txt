The Wine dataset contains the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 different constituents found in each of the three types of wines. The target variable represents the cultivar or class label of each sample. The dataset consists of a total of 178 samples, with 59 samples for each cultivar.
