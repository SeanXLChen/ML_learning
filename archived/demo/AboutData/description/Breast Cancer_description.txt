The Breast Cancer dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) samples of breast mass. These features describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images. The dataset includes measurements such as radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and others. The target variable represents the diagnosis of the breast mass as malignant or benign. The dataset consists of a total of 569 samples, with 212 malignant and 357 benign samples.
