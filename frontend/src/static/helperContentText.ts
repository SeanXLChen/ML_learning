      kernel:
        "he kernel is a function that transforms the input data into a higher-dimensional space. It allows SVM to find a linear decision boundary in this transformed space, even when the original data is not linearly separable. Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, and radial basis functions (RBF). The kernel effectively enables SVM to handle complex data and improve its classification performance.",
      "Margin(C)":
        "the margin (C) is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin between classes and minimizing classification errors. A smaller value of C allows a wider margin but may tolerate some misclassifications, while a larger value of C enforces a narrower margin with fewer misclassifications. It helps in balancing the desire to have a good separation between classes while avoiding overfitting to noisy data.",
      Gamma:
        "gamma (\u{03B3}) is a parameter associated with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The gamma value determines the influence of individual data points on the shape of the decision boundary.",
